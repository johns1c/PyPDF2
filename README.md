# PyPDF2
PyPDF2 for Python 3 

This is a revised version of PyPDF2 with a number of fixes and extensions 
1)  Python 3  only
2)  extended character set handling (extract to text works in many cases it did not before) 
3)  bug fixes 
 
 But 
*) My code is not the best - symbol naming conventions are mixed
*) Most literals have just been changed to binary strings rather than a more systematic approach
*) testing is not systematic - although I have run a large number of test PDFs through the viewer built on this code
*) No systematic approach to handing Postscript
*) Still not got the codecs exactly matching the spec
